MODEL METRICS SUMMARY
=====================

Evaluation Metric:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Lower values indicate better out-of-sample predictive performance

Train/Test Split:
- Time-based split
- Training: historical data up to split point
- Testing: held-out future period (strictly out-of-sample)


MODELS EVALUATED
----------------

FINAL MODEL SELECTION
---------------------

Selected Model:
- Seasonal Naive Baseline

Reason for Selection:
- Achieved the lowest RMSE among all evaluated models
- More complex models did not improve predictive accuracy
- Provides strong interpretability and minimal computational overhead
- Best suited for short-term (up to 7 days) hourly traffic forecasting
